      <p>I am Ziena Mohamed, and I am a 16-year-old Egyptian girl. "In a world full of spectacular things to do and to
        love, why do I have to limit myself to doing one thing?". This is a quote that I genuinely believe in and that
        drives me in all aspects of my personality. I think that coding and programming take apart from me and
        JustTravelers is the first website that I had done with my lovely team</p>
